# Discord-MemeBot-Project
A simple yet entertaining Discord bot built with Python that generates memes on command. By typing $meme in the server chat, the bot fetches and displays a random meme instantly. This project helped me practice working with APIs, handling bot commands, and improving my understanding of real-time interactions on Discord
